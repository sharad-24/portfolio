               Hi guys welcome to my blog. In this blog we are talking about a Deep Learning of GitHub and GitBash
              </p>
              <p>
            <b> What is GitHub?</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>
             To understand GitHub, we have to first understand what is GIT.
              </b></p>
              <p>
              So GIT was introduced by Linus Torvalds, the person who created Linux.
             </p>
<p>
Git is a version control system. When builders create something like an app, for example, they make everyday adjustments to the code.
</p>
<p>
Version control systems maintain those updates precise, storing the modification in a central repository. This permits developers to interact easily, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and add new updates. Every developer can see these new modifications, download them and contribute.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Now the meaning of “HUB” in GitHub?</b>
</p>
<p>
In GitHub, Git is a command-line tool and Hub is an environment around which all the stuff of Git revolves. Hub provides an environment in which all developers can save or post their projects for the availability of user.
</p>
<p>
<b>GitHub Main Branches:</b>
              </p>
             
              <b><p>
             *Repositories
           </p>
              <p>*Branch</p>
<p>*Commits</p>
<p>*Pull Request</p>

       
              <p>REPOSITORIES:</p></b>
              <p>As we make a unique folder for every project in our computer system. Similarly we use repositories in GitHub. However, the role of repositories is not completed yet, but it has the capability of making branch, commits and Pull Request.</p>
              <p>A GitHub repository may be used to keep a development project.</p>
              <p>It can contain folders and any sort of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Documents, Data, and Images).</p>
              <p><b>BRANCH:</b></p>
              <p>GitHub branch is used to work on different versions of Git Repository at the same time.</p>
              <p>The main benefit of having a Master branch in the repository is that it provides you a URL from which you can browse your uploaded project across the globe. </p>
              <p><b>COMMITS:</b></p>
              <p>Commits are defined as changes, which you make in your repository code. These commits are recorded in your commit section where you can see on which date and time you or your contributors make a commit in your source code.</p>
              <p><b>PULL-REQUEST:</b></p>
              <p>In GitHub repository, you can include contributor in your project file. In simple words, we can say that by the use of repository we can work on the same platform on the same project across the world. Now a new problem arises, like if you make someone a contributor in your project then he/she can have full right to change your source code, so Git introduces pull request in which a contributor suggests his/her changes in source code and if it is acceptable then it can be committed by the owner of that project. This functionality decreases chances of Losing main Source Code.</p>
              <p><b>Hence, we talk plenty about GitHub, so let's discuss about it use:</b></p>
              <p>Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com/) and simply sign-up to your new account.</p>
              <p>After signing-up, you can see the NEW option on the left Conner of your screen. From this option, you can create your new repository and simply add files to it. However, after uploading one and two projects in your repository you realize that this is not a perfect way to add files in the repository because every time we have to drag a single file and upload it which takes lot of time.</p>
              <p>Therefore, to overcome this problem GitHub introduced Git-Bash Software.</p>


              <p><b>What is Git-Bash?</b></p>
<div class="post-thumb">
              <img src="img/images.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
            </div>
              <p>Git-Bash is a command-line prompt which helps the user to upload or push his/her all files of a project to a desired repository without dragging one-one file every time.</p>
              <p><b>How to Use Git-Bash:</b></p>

              <p>Download Git for your system from (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it in your system. Now I am going to show you how to use the Git-Bash.</p>
              <p>I will show you how I can upload my full project file on GitHub by applying some commands on Git-Bash.</p>
              <p>In this video, I uploaded my project folder to my GitHub repository by using Git-Bash, so please follow all the steps carefully.</p>
              <p>In this video, I clearly explained how you could simply commit all you project data to your Git repository in a few seconds rather than scrolling one-one file every time manually.</p>

              <p><b>Now I am going to explain all commands, which we use during Git-Bash:</b></p>
              <p><b>Step1:</b> In the first step, we are going to sign-in our username into Git-Bash using (git config –global user.name “your user name”)</p>
              <p><b>Step2:</b> Similarly, we add our email-id by using (git config –global user.emil your email-id “your user email-id”)</p>
              <p><b>Step3:</b> In this step, we initialize our Git-Bash file in our target folder using (git init)</p>
              <p><b>Step4:</b> As our Git-Bash is now initialized, we are going to add all the files of our target folder by using (git add .)</p>
              <p><b>Step5:</b> Now as our files are added, we attach one comment to our commit so the change can be explained by using (git commit –m “your message”)</p>
              <p><b>Step6:</b> In this step, we move our file to the server by using (git remote add origin “URL of our origin”)</p>
              <p><b>Step7:</b> Now if you check the status of your files it shows "nothing pushed or committed",this message arises because you were adding your files to your remote origin means they are not pushed to the repository of your GitHub.</p>
              <p><b>Step8:</b> So to push your all data to your existing repository use the command (git push –u origin master).</p>
              <p><b>Step9:</b> Now as you refresh your repository it shows you all your files, which you pushed through Git-Bash. Now just go to settings option and make your repository on master branch, which will provide you a URL from where you can access your project and show-cast it across the globe</p>
              <p>That’s all guys, I think this blog will help you to understand the importance of Git-Bash in GitHub.</p>
              <p>Thank you,</p>
